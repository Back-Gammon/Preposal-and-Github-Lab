During the development of this game, we got farther then we originally imagined we would. Unity made it very easy to do some things and made is VERY difficult for other things. 
Accessing the assest that we used for the game was simple since there were plenty of free material within the internet (all of the models and animations are from Unity Assest Store
or Mixamo as well as some being originally coded within unity). In terms of designing the terrain and platfroms, we tried to be safe and not bite off more then we can swallow (we 
originally tried adding texturized animated grass to the forest terrain, but that was a whole can of worms. Creating and applying the scripts for the game was also a hassle, we tried
coding in a monster villain (of which you can see the remains of in the scripts) that would chase the player around in game as well as a start screen, but we couldn't properly link either
one to their corresponding assets. The music is from freesounds.org aswell. The most difficult part about this project was definetly the C# coding and the unity engine being weird. We tried
creating many builds but they also came out as the wrong type, glitched, or not propperly zipped. Having the tiles randomly generate and getting the player model to collect the coins was 
also a hurdle that we conquered.
